Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning 🏥🤖
Here we are going to build a Machine Learning System to predict Medical Insurance cost of a person 💵

Let's say there is a Medical Insurance company and this company wants to create an automatic system that can predict what is a medical insurance cost of a person, using the data provided. 📊🏢
We will follow the standard workflow from getting the dataset to the data analysis and data preprocessing. 🔄📈

Our model predicts the cost of an insurance correctly for about 84% of time. 🎯
